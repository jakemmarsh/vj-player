VJ-Player
=========

VJ-Player is a real-time, interactive web application built on Meteor.js. 

- It allows users to host or join "parties", in which they are able to play Youtube (and Vimeo?) videos in real-time with their friends.
- "Parties" may be either private (password-protected) or public. 
- Users within parties are able to "upvote" and "downvote" videos in order to express their opinions on them.
